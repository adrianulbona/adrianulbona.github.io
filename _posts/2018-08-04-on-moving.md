title: On Moving (how we ended up in Copenhagen)
---


### The Trigger 

While scrapping notes from the beginning of the year found something like: _analyze what would mean to live abroad for 
a few years (pros/cons)_ ...

By that time we were in [Cluj](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluj-Napoca) (Romania). Now we are in 
[Copenhagen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copenhagen) (Denmark) and already feel that we know the city. 

Considering Romanian standards we had really good jobs in Romania, we were a bit upset on the political situation ...
other than that, maybe a bit bored ... 

You finish your studies, you have your first job, you get your second job, you try an amazing third job, but that’s it!? 
Buy a car, a house, build a family, raise children? … and finally wait to be _garbage collected_. Sounds standard, 
somehow traditional ... 

By mid-february, Andi got contacted by a Microsoft recruiter for a position in Copenhagen. First, she didn’t gave it 
too much attention as she felt comfortable with what she was doing back then … but after an initial call, she got an 
invitation for interview in Copenhagen.

I remember asking: _what if you get an offer?_ … and the answer was something like: _don’t worry, for sure I will not 
get an offer ..._. Guess what!? Andi did great on the interview and an offer came ... and now what!? Panic! 

We had to take a decision in a few days. Started to read about Denmark, Copenhagen, Danes, Vikings, IT industry, called 
the parents and decided to give it a try. Only afterwards we realised what we did.

### The Move

We are in the beginning of March and Andi had to start the new job on the 15th of May. What followed was something quite new, 
maybe a bit stressful, but definitely not boring! 

We had to quit our jobs and this was something quite difficult . In any job, you usually develop personal relationships 
with colleagues and you care about the projects you work on. Quitting might be a bit hard, but if the decision has been 
made, doing it as soon as possible helps you avoid unnecessary stress.

Getting a new job. I was fairly confident that I could easily find a job so that by the 15th of May I can also actually start 
in the new place. I targeted _Data Engineering_ roles, as this is the technical role which I liked most in the past. 

Started by cleaning-up and update my CV. Got Linkedin Premium so that I can get a bit more information about the 
companies from Copenhagen and started to apply on the jobs that I found on Linkedin and Glassdoor. 

After around one week, as I didn’t got too many responses, got a bit worried and started to think about alternatives: 
 - reach people I knew in Copenhagen
 - connect with recruiters on Linkedin
 - grow the personal Linkedin network with professionals from the same field I was interested  
 - search local start-ups; [thehub.dk](https://thehub.dk) is a great place for this
 - search jobs on alternative platforms; found on [stackoverflow.com/jobs](https://stackoverflow.com/jobs) some 
 really interesting job posting

Putting all this together, I started to have interviews and by the end of March I was considering three companies: 
 - [easysize.me](https://www.easysize.me) - an interesting small start-up
 - [jayway.com](https://www.jayway.com) - a software studio
 - [tradeshift.com](https://tradeshift.com) - a not so small start-up

For the final decision I considered the last two. The [tradeshift.com](https://tradeshift.com) role seemed the most 
challenging and interesting, but visiting the [jayway.com](https://www.jayway.com) office made the decision quite 
complicated as the discussions and the people there were amazing. In the end I picked the unicorn 
([tradeshift.com](https://tradeshift.com)). 

Having this sorted out, the next item on the list was to find a place to live. Rents in Copenhagen are quite expensive 
(probably it is difficult to find an apartment in a nice area with less than 1500 euro / month), a considerable deposit 
is required (we’ve seen on average sums equivalent to 3 months of rent), the contract are usually long-term and the 
apartments are usually not furnished. This seemed too complex to get it right remotely so we started to search for 
alternatives and we found [lifex](https://www.joinlifex.com). [lifex](https://www.joinlifex.com) is a Danish start-up 
that tries to address this problem. You lose a bit of privacy, but you get nice people around and you stay in amazing 
apartments in the center of the city. In a few days we already had a contract for a room at 
[lifex](https://www.joinlifex.com).

Next thing on the list: do something with all the stuff we gathered in Cluj. We always had in mind the fact that we 
don’t have too much stuff. We were wrong, but we couldn’t believe how much stuff we had. The majority of the things 
were never/once used and on some small things you could get emotional ... anyway … we managed to ship nearly everything 
to our parents and we both remained with things that fit into a suitcase and a backpack. There is a particular article 
that helped on this: 
[Getting Rid of All Your Stuff Feels Like Taking a Big, Dreamy Dump](https://thedeepdish.org/getting-rid-of-all-your-stuff-minimalism-101/).

Finally, trying to meet with all people we care for. This can be quite emotional and definitely it’s the most difficult 
part.

### The Landing

![landing]({{ site.url }}/assets/2018-08-04-moving-cph.jpg)

It was 1st of May when from the sunny and hot Cluj, we landed in Copenhagen where it was raining and the temperature 
was a bit higher than 10 (celsius) degrees. We got scared, but there was not much to do about it. 

Next day it was better and we started to do the paperwork (we reserved 2 weeks for this; 
[movingtocph.com](https://www.movingtocph.com) is a great guide that explains all the necessary steps). Practically, 
we went to the [International House](https://ihcph.kk.dk/) and the whole process (EU registration, Social Security Number, Tax Card) took 
around 90 minutes. It took another 30 minutes for a bank account. This is how we ended up with nearly two weeks of free 
time. We packed our stuff and had a few great days in Berlin, came back to Copenhagen, packed again and had a few more 
beers with our friends in Cluj. 

By the time we came back the weather became perfect, the parks were green and full of people and we were ready to 
start the new jobs.

It’s been 3 months and contrary to what we expected, the summer was quite hot and cooling systems are not really a 
thing here … I don’t even remember when it properly rain last time. As this was completely unexpected, the bikes we 
bought paid themselves; exploring the city with the bike is amazing (Copenhagen is the most bike friendly city I’ve 
seen) ...

It’s been 3 months with new people around, new jobs in a totally new place for both of us. We had to adapt and 
sometimes it felt a bit difficult but getting outside the comfort zone makes you feel alive and the new experiences 
that you have will probably be the memories you will share and think about in the future.

We didn’t move to Copenhagen to retire here, we moved to Copenhagen because it was a great chance to do something 
different and to avoid getting too rusty … and it seems to be working.
