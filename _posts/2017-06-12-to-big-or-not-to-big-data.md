Big Data today is not as sexy as it was. Now that the hype is gone ... what actually Big Data is and what is not? Lets start with a bit of history.

Short Big Data History

What Big Data promised in the first place?

... a set of tools and techniques for you get insights over large volumes of data - and this is what what we got in nearly 15 years! Now it's so easy to query terabytes of data in plain SQL and you might even not know that behind it's "big data".

In a way Big Data destroyed its myth by making itself too to accessible. 

But the future?
