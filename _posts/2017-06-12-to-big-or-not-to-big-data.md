title: To Big or Not To Big Data
---

Big Data today is not as sexy as it was. Now that the hype is gone ... what actually Big Data is and what is not? Lets start with a bit of history.

Short Big Data History
---
- 2003 Distributed Storage: [Google File System Paper](http://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/ja//archive/gfs-sosp2003.pdf)
- 2004 Distributed Computation: [MapReduce: Simplified Data Processing on Large Clusters Paper](https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//archive/mapreduce-osdi04.pdf)
- 2006 Distributed Storage & Computation Implementation: [Hadoop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Hadoop)
- 2006 Distributed Random Access: [Bigtable: A Distributed Storage System for Structured Data Paper](https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//archive/bigtable-osdi06.pdf)
- 2007 Distributed Random Access Implementation [HBase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_HBase)
- 2008 - 2012 1st gen. Horizontal Development (Hadoop Maturity, Ecosystem Enrichment)
- 2012 Distributed Data Structures [Resilient Distributed Datasets: a fault-tolerant abstraction for in-memory cluster computing](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/nsdi12/nsdi12-final138.pdf)
- 2014 Spark becomes Apache project [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org) 
- 2014 - 2017 2st gen. Horizontal Development (Spark Maturity, phasing-out Map-Reduce)

What Big Data promised in the first place?

... a set of tools and techniques for you get insights over large volumes of data - and this is what what we got in nearly 15 years! Now it's so easy to query terabytes of data in plain SQL and you might even not know that behind it's "big data".

In a way Big Data destroyed its myth by making itself too to accessible. 

What is not Big Data?

Big Data is not the ultimate Machine Learning tool. Even if the Big Data techniques and tools can be used to implement Machine Learning tasks, when you run to Deep Learning don't bully Big Data. 

Don't forget that the same [Jeff Dean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Dean_(computer_scientist)) that contributed to the initial Big Data revolution (see the MapReduce and BigTable papers authors) made also Deep Learning scalable through [TensorFlow](http://download.tensorflow.org/paper/whitepaper2015.pdf).

But the future?

What will the 3rd gen. of tools? Will there be one or ...
