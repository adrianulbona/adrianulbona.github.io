How much time you spend on your phone every day? How much time you stay in front of a computer every day? How do you 
communicate with your friends? What happens when you transfer money? For sure there is no little man moving banknotes 
around … 

… or maybe there is a gang of leprechauns behind that moves all these bits and pieces of information around … now, 
whatever is behind, it seems to be able to follow a set of instructions quite reliably … every time you want to share 
the awesome pictures with you at that fancy place, your message gets broadcasted without questions.

This sequence of instructions, the leprechauns are able to follow, is called a program. 

Programming is nothing else but the activity to tell leprechauns what to do in certain situations.

Usually, the programs are quite specific so that the leprechauns can understand them … but you see … this is the problem. 

In order to understand this we have to take a look on the history of leprechauns, more precisely on what leprechauns 
did in WWII. It is hard to believe, but 129,000 leprechauns in the WWII were involved in everything what was needed 
in order to build the atom bomb; also a considerable number of leprechauns helped the Nazi regime to build the 
concentration camps. 

Leprechauns don’t ask questions, as one isolated task is quite meaningless, they just follow instructions … that’s why 
no one got upset on them after WWII … 

Putting the leprechauns aside for a moment and taking things a bit more seriously, for sure leprechauns are also 
contributing to good things: we started to explore the space, we can instantly chat all across the planet, we can 
read about [Eyjafjallajökull](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eyjafjallaj%C3%B6kull) and so on … 

_Programming is colorless. Programs are only tools. Leprechauns are just leprechauns. So, when something bad happens, 
probably we have to blame the programmers … but what if programmers are leprechauns!? ;)_
